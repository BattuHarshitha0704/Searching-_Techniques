# Searching_Techniques Webpage

This project provides an interactive webpage to learn about and implement two common search algorithms: **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**. The webpage allows users to enter an array of numbers and search for a specific element, showcasing the differences between these two search methods.

## Features

- **Search Method Selection**: Choose between Linear Search and Binary Search.
- **Dynamic Input Fields**: Enter the desired number of elements for the array.
- **Interactive Searching**: Input an element to search for and see results instantly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### How to Use

1. **Select a Search Method**:
   - Choose "Linear Search" or "Binary Search" from the dropdown menu.

2. **Set Array Size**:
   - Enter a positive integer to define the number of elements in the array.
   - Click the "Set Array Size" button to generate input fields.

3. **Enter Array Elements**:
   - Fill in each input field with numeric values.

4. **Enter the Search Element**:
   - Type the number you want to search for in the provided input.

5. **Perform the Search**:
   - Click the "Search" button to execute the search.
   - For Binary Search, ensure the array is sorted; alerts will notify you if it's not.

6. **View Results**:
   - The result will display the index of the found element or indicate if it wasn't found.

## Technical Overview

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for a visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for search algorithms and dynamic user interactions.

### Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure.
